# Better

This is a browser extensions that recommends better alternatives to products and service that you're currently visiting. "Better" could mean ethical or cheaper or local or higher-quality or something else. So, while we ship a default list, users will be able to subscribe to multiple sources for recommendations.

This is a work-in-progress and not yet published. This should work for both Chromium-based (Chrome, Brave, Chromium etc) AND Firefox-based browsers.
